program. It contains character tables that are used when no external
tables are passed to PCRE2 by the application that calls it. The tables
are used only for characters whose code values are less than 256. */

/* This set of tables was written in the C locale. */

/* The pcre2_ftables program (which is distributed with PCRE2) can be used
to build alternative versions of this file. This is necessary if you are
running in an EBCDIC environment, or if you want to default to a different
encoding, for example ISO-8859-1. When pcre2_dftables is run, it creates
these tables in the "C" locale by default. This happens automatically if
PCRE2 is configured with --enable-rebuild-chartables. However, you can run
pcre2_dftables manually with the -L option to build tables using the LC_ALL
locale. */
